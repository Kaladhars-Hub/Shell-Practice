#Variables are labeled boxes where we store information (Ingredients)

#We Create a Variable by giving it a name and a value."No spaces around the = sign".

#Example:1

#Correct way of representing Variables.

name="Alice"
age=20

#Wrong way of representing Variables.
name = "Alice"

#To get the value out of the box,we use the dollar sign "$" (Think of $ as "gimme the value").

#Example
echo "Hello, $name"
echo "you are $age years old"
